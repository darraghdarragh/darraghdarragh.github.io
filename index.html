        <p>
          Dear Hiring Manager,
        </p>
        <p>
          I am writing to express my interest in a Software Engineer or Technical Consultant position.
          With a background in Computer Science and practical experience in RESTful APIs, AWS integration, and full-stack development,
          I am confident I can make a meaningful contribution to your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience with Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3, as well as strong familiarity with Agile workflows
          and version control using GitHub. My work at Taoglas as a Software Engineer Intern gave me valuable insight into real-world
          software design, collaboration, and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a Higher Diploma in Computing (AI & ML) at the National College of Ireland, which is further strengthening
          my technical and analytical abilities. I am particularly passionate about leveraging technology to improve user experience and
          automate processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your organization’s goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kind regards,<br>
          <strong>Darragh Morrissey</strong>
